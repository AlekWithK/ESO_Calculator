Description: This simple software features a few useful calculators pertaining to The Elder Scrolls Online game.

The Parse Normalizer works to mitigate discrepancies caused in a parse due to over or under-criting. This is useful for testing setups and builds as it removes some of the variation that crit chance adds to any parse.

The Crit Calculator allows you to input your expected buffs and uptimes and returns the average and max values of your critical damage given your inputs. This is great of determining what CP or setup my be necessary to ensure you're as close to the critical damage cap as possible, without going past it.

The Kilt Cheatsheet is simply an image stripped from my online kilt spreadsheet that shows the locations in which Harpooner's Kilt is strong or not. There is also a button that will take you to the online version, which includes useful comments.

If you click on any of these tabs and drag to the left you will find a fourth tab that gives assistance in using the Parse Normalizer and Crit Calculator, as well as contact information.

If you have any suggestions, comments, or bugs to report, feel free to contact me on Discord!

This software is in no way intended to be professional. It was simply a pet project of mine to play around with new Python APIs, but create something useful at the same time.

The build files and resources for this project are all marked as 'Hidden' in the Windows Explorer to keep from overwhelming users. If you're a developer and would like to poke around, or view my beautifully medicore code, just enable viewing of hidden files.
